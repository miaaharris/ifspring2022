        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Mia Harris and I'm a junior majoring in Communication Design.</p>
        <p>2. I have a background in fine art and graphic/digital design. I've been making art for as long as I can remember and I became interested specifically in graphic design in 11th grade when I took a graphic design class as a prerequisite for AP 2D art. I'm mostly taking this class because it is a requirement for the Communication Design BFA program. However, I also am excited to be able to learn how to code a website because I think it is a really important skill to have as a graphic designer.</p>
        <p>3. The HTML/CSS/JS experience I have is from an introductory computer science class I took in the fall of 11th grade.</p>
        <p>4. I want to learn how to design and code the layout of a website!</p>
        <p>5. As a Communication Design major, I am used to designing on the screen. From this, I know that dimensions and scale are much different on the screen than on paper.</p> 
        <p>6. I think <a href="https://theanimalpad.org/">The Animal Pad</a>'s website is an example of effective design. The tabs make it easy to navigate the subtopics on the weboage and everything is easily accessible to the user.</p>
        <p>7. I think the website <a href="https://www.instructables.com">Instructables</a> exemplifies effective communication. Though it may not be very aesthetically pleasing, everything is laid out in a navigatable way and the information on the site is able to be found quite easily.</p>
        <p>8. I love the <a href="https://informlibrary.com/">In Form Library</a> website and think it works well. The site is simple yet exciting to navigable, and it utilizes a grid format, which makes it pleasing to the eye.</p>
