        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, such as confections, and possibly a beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. In some parts of the world, such as much of central and western Africa, and most parts of China and India, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.

        <p>
            The term dessert can apply to many confections, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatins, ice creams, pastries, pies, puddings, sweet soups, tarts and fruit salad. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts.

        <h3>Etymology</h3>
        
        <p>
            The word "dessert" originated from the French word desservir, meaning "to clear the table." Its first known use was in 1600, in a health education manual entitled Naturall and artificial Directions for Health, written by William Vaughan.
        </p>
        <p>
            In his A History of Dessert (2013), Michael Krondl explains that it refers to the fact that dessert was served after the table had been cleared of other dishes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term dates from the 14th century but attained its current meaning around the beginning of the 20th century, when "service à la française" (setting a variety of dishes on the table at the same time) was replaced with "service à la russe" (presenting a meal in courses).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Other Names</h3>
        
        <p>
            The word "dessert" is most commonly used for this course in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United States, while it is one of several synonyms (including "pudding", "sweet" and "afters") in the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries.
        </p>
        
        
        <h3>Nutrition</h3>
        
        <p>Dessert foods often contain relatively high amounts of sugar and fats and, as a result, higher calorie counts per gram than other foods. Fresh or cooked fruit with minimal added sugar or fat is an exception.</p>
