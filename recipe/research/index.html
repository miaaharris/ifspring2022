        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <b>Chicken Paprikash</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towel, then sprinkle generously with Lawry's seasoned salt, pepper, and a little flour.</li>
            <li>Heat oil over medium/high heat in a large skillet or dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Brown chicken on both sides for several minutes until golden. It doesn't need to be cooked through, just needs to get a little crispy on the outside.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken and add onions to the pan.</li>
            <li>Cook onions until soft and golden, then add chicken back into pan.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle chicken and onions evenly with parprika and add water.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 90 minutes. *add more water if needed while cooking; you want to have plenty of gravy!</li>
        </ol>
        <b>Dumplings</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, eggs, water, and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Stir until it's stretchy and has the texture of chewing gum. Add more water, flour, or egg as needed to get a stretchy texture.</li>
            <li>Put the dough onto a cutting board and cut off very small pieces.</li>
            <li>Flick pieces of dough into the boiling water and cook for a few minutes. The dumplings will float to the surface when done.</li>
            <li>Serve chicken over dumplings and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
